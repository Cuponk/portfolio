				<h2>Who I am</h2>
				<p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio! I am a young software engineer with a knack for learning new
					technologies and a passion for programming.</p>
				<div class="features">
					<section>
						<span class="icon solid major fa-lightbulb"></span>
						<h3>How I started</h3>
						<p>The preverbal lightbulb went off when in 4th grade I built a minecraft server so that my
							friends and I could play together. I fell in love with the process and that passions went to
							the next level in 7th grade when I built my own computer which I still use to this day.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<span class="icon solid major fa-graduation-cap"></span>
						<h3>Educational Background</h3>
						<p>After graduating high school, I took some college classes in computer science. After two
							years, I decided to take a chance and join the
							App Academy boot camp to learn the technology thats being used today and jump start my
							career
							as a software engineer.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<span class="icon solid major fa-code"></span>
						<h3>Skills and Expertise</h3>
						<p>
							I have experience with Javascript, Ruby, React, Redux, Rails, SQL, HTML, CSS, Git, and
							Heroku. I am always looking to learn new technologies and expand my skill set.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<span class="icon solid major fa-desktop"></span>
						<h3>Projects and Collaborations</h3>
						<p>
							During my time at App Academy, I have worked on different projects each using different
							tech stacks. One project I am excited about is a Discord clone where users can chat with
							each other in real time.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<span class="icon solid major fa-infinity"></span>
						<h3>Continuous Learning</h3>
						<p> In this ever-evolving field, staying up-to-date is crucial. I am continuously looking to
							expand my skill set through online courses, open-source contributions, and attending tech
							meet-ups. I am an active member of several coding communities, where I both learn from and
							mentor aspiring developers.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<span class="icon solid major fa-heart"></span>
						<h3>Passions and Hobbies</h3>
						<p>When I'm not coding, I have a passion for video games and sports, specifically baseball. My
							favorite teams are the Los Angeles Dodgers and Minnesota Twins. I've been a baseball fanatic
							since I was a kid and I've been apart of the game in many different ways. I've played for
							almost ten years and coached and even umpired for little league games.
